Watson
======
This is a simple puzzle game where you play as Dr. Watson and solve all the crimes that Sherlock is too lazy to solve himself (based on original books not tv show)

Tips
----
* Due to the game's odd parser only four characters of each word is read. 
**If there are more than 4 character in each word bad things will happen as there is no error handling at the moment!**
This means that to "give sherlock evidence" (**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!**) you would type 
    give sher evid
