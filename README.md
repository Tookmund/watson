Watson
======
### Status: Incomplete
This is a simple puzzle game where you play as Dr. Watson and solve all the crimes that Sherlock is too lazy to solve himself (based on original books not tv show)

Tips
----
Due to the game's odd parser only four characters of each word is read. <br />
**If there are more than 4 character in each word bad things will happen as there is no error handling at the moment!** <br />
This means that to "give sherlock evidence" (**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!**) you would type: <br />

````
give sher evid
````
